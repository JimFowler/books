Installation
************

BookEntry uses the python library *distutils* to install and distribute thepackages. The BookEntry package may be installed from the Tools directory with the command

``python3 setup.py install``

My default is to install all the packages required for BookEntry in my
home directory so I use

``python3 setup.py install --home=~``
