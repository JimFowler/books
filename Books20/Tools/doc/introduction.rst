Introduction
************

The **BookEntry** program is part of the *Books20* project, which is
designed to catalog books published in Astronomy and Astrophysics
during the 20th Century. **BookEntry** is designed to ease the
cataloging of entries found in the annual bibliographies
*Astronomischer Jahrsbericht* (AJB) by providing a graphical interface
that focuses on the information and not on the formatting.  Previous
cataloging was done using Microsoft Word™ using text entry and
comma-separated fields.  With this method however, there were numerous
problems in keeping the fields in the proper place particularly
because there was often missing field data in the AJB entries.  Many
passes with Microsoft Excel™ and other testing tools were required
to spot these problems by eye.

**BookEntry** was developed in Python 3.2.3 under Ubuntu 12.04 and uses
Qt 4.8.1 with PyQt 4.9.1 for the graphical portions of the software.
