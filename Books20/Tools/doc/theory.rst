Introduction

 Books20 project, indexing all books published in astronomy during the
 20th Century. AJB and AAA. Used Microsoft Office Word(tm) because I
 could insert now english charactors, but the text files were hard to
 handle. Wanted to be able to parse with a computer program so the
 format had to be very strict. But that meant I spent most of the time
 on the formatting and not on the content of the entry. Formatting was
 hard to workout in the Word file because stuff did not line up.  If
 we converted to Excel format it was still hard.  many mistakes found
 even after multiple reviews.
