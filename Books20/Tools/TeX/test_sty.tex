\section{Title and project commands}

Test any new commands created.

\verb|\ProjectTitle| results in \ProjectTitle.

\verb|\BooksTitle| results in \BookTitle.

\verb|\bt{A Book Title}| results in \bt{A Book Title}.

\verb|\Ord{2}{nd}| produces an ordinal \Ord{2}{nd} or perhaps
in the French \verb|\Ord{2}{e}| as \Ord{2}{e}.

the \verb|\Cen{}| command.  The \verb|\Cen{}| can only handle
centuries 1 through 29.
