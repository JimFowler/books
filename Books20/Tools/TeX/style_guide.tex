\title{Style Guide for the \PTitle\ Project}

\maketitle

\section{General Comments}

Documents for the \PTitle\ project should be written in \LaTeX\ and use
the books20.sty package Most documents will be articles but the
manuscript should be in the books document class. The reasoning behind
using \LaTeX\ is that I expect academic publishers to prefer or at
least have available a \LaTeX\ class package.  It will be difficult if
I need to convert these documents to Microsoft Word\texttrademark or
some other formatting package.

The \LaTeX\ style files books20.sty shall be used in all
\LaTeX\ documents. To include it use \verb|\usepackage{books20}|, there
are no options to this style file at this time.

Tables should be in longtable style and should have a caption with two
hlines after the heading and at the end.  All documents should include
the package \verb|\usepackage{longtable}|.

Use the serial comma. For example, we write this, that, and the other
things.

Books title shall be in \bt{italics}. Use the command
\verb|\bt{My Book Title}| to produce \bt{My Book Title} in this
sentence.

\section{Defined command in books20.sty}

\begin{itemize}

\item \verb|\Cen{19}| is used to produce century names,
  e.g.\ \Cen{19}. Note that it works only for centuries that use the
  \textsuperscript{th} format.  That is, it won't work for the
  21\textsuperscript{st} Century, the 2\textsuperscript{nd} Century, or the
  3\textsuperscript{rd} Century. I should probably fix this issue.

\item \verb|\bt{Book Title}| produces book titles in italic face,
e.g.\ \bt{Book Title} is the title of a book.

\item \verb|\PTitle\ | produces the project title in bold face,
  e.g.\ the \PTitle\ project is the name of this project.

\item \verb|\BTitle\ | produces the book title in italic face, e.g.\ \BTitle\ or whatever I (or my editor) chooses for a title.

\end{itemize}

\section{An Example Document}

Put an example document here so I can see what the \LaTeX\ commands are.
