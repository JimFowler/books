\chapter{English Grammer and Syntax}
%\import{./}(style_grammer}
\begin{itemize}

\item Dashes and Hyphens --- The dash `-' is used for compound-words and for
  hyphenation at the end of a line.  The en-dash `--' is used for a range
  of numbers, 1 -- 10. The em-dash `---' is used for punctuation ---
  e.g.\ separating phrases.

\item Date format --- Use the ISO-8601\cite{isotime} style
  YYYY-MM-DD for dates and hh:mm:ss for time. Use YYYY or YYYY-MM
  and hh:mm for abbreviated year-month and hours-minutes.

\item Tables should be in longtable style and should have a caption
  with two hlines after the heading and at the end. The
  \texttt{longtable} package is loaded in the \texttt{books20}
  package.

\item You may also use the functions in table.py in a python script to create
  a table in \LaTeX\ longtable format.  I'll write some documentation someday
  but for now you can look at ./Doc/Series/assl\_table.py.

\item Use the serial comma --- for example, we write this, that, and
  use a serial comma for the last item.

\item Books title shall be in \bt{italics}. Use the command
  \verb|\bt{My Book Title}| to produce \bt{My Book Title} in a
  sentence. Note that \verb|\bt{}| can be changed in \texttt{books20}
  packages to produce another style if necessary.

 Other font choices?
