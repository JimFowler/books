\section{General Comments}

Documents for the \PTitle\ project should be written in \LaTeX\ and use
the books20.sty package Most documents will be articles but the
manuscript should be in the books document class. The reasoning behind
using \LaTeX\ is that I expect academic publishers to prefer or at
least have available a \LaTeX\ class package.  It will be difficult if
I need to convert these documents to Microsoft Word\texttrademark or
some other formatting package.

\subsection{Document Design}

\begin{itemize}
  
\item The \LaTeX\ style files books20.sty shall be used in all
  \LaTeX\ documents. To include it use \verb|\usepackage{books20}|, there
  are no options to this style file at this time. Note that books20.sty
  is designed for \LaTeXe\ and may not work with \LaTeX\ 2.09.
  

\item Place sections in a separate file and use an include command in the
  document file. Then it is possible to use the section file in a
  different document with out having to clean up the document commands.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Specifics}

\begin{itemize}

\item Dashes and Hypens --- The dash `-' is used for compound words and for
  hypenation at the end of a line.  The en-dash `--' is used for a range
  of numbers. The em-dash `---' is used for punctuation,
  e.g.\ separating phrases.

\item Date format --- Use the
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601}{ISO-8601} style
  YYYY-MM-DD for dates and hh:mm:ss for time.

\item Tables should be in longtable style and should have a caption with two
  hlines after the heading and at the end.  All documents should include
  the package \verb|\usepackage{longtable}|.

\item Use the serial comma --- for example, we write this, that, and the
  other things.

\item Books title shall be in \bt{italics}. Use the command
  \verb|\bt{My Book Title}| to produce \bt{My Book Title} in a
  sentence. Note that \verb|\bt{}| can be changed in books20.sty
  to produce another style if necessary.

\end{itemize}


\section{Defined command in books20.sty}

\begin{itemize}

\item \verb|\Cen{19}| is used to produce century names,
  e.g.\ \Cen{19}. Note that it works only for centuries that use the
  \textsuperscript{th} format.  That is, it won't work for the
  21\textsuperscript{st} Century, the 2\textsuperscript{nd} Century, or the
  3\textsuperscript{rd} Century, etc. I should probably fix this issue.

\item \verb|\bt{Book Title}| produces book titles in italic face,
e.g.\ \bt{Book Title} is the title of a book.

\item \verb|\PTitle\ | produces the project title in bold face,
  e.g.\ the \PTitle\ project is the name of this project.

\item \verb|\BTitle\ | produces the book title in italic face, e.g.\ \BTitle\ or whatever I (or my editor) chooses for a title.

\end{itemize}

\section{An Example Document}

Here is an example document so you can see what the \LaTeX\ commands are.
