The documentation for the Books20 project is old
and has not been updated in quite a long time. New
tools have been added and new methodologies have been
incorporated. These need to be documented.

My current plan (27 May 2024) is to create one document
for the project. The tentative table of contents is,

1. Introduction
  1.1 What is the Books20 project
  1.2 Brief description of the tools, ajbbooks, journals, etc.
  1.3 Layout of this document
2. Installation
3. Using the tools
4. Detailed description of the file formats and tools
5. Code listings.

To create images,

Use gimp File->Create->Screenshot to capture the window display
Then File->Export as .png to Books20/Tools/doc/images

This will not be a short project
