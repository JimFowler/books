Pagination (part of the physical description)


30 May 2016

The original pagination scheme was '<front>+<main> pp'.  This
worked fine for use with Microsoft Word and text based entry. The 'pp'
made it clear where the field was in the comma-separated
list. However, it soon became clear that there was more information in
the entries than I was recording.  When I switched to the ajbbooks 1.0
program the 'pp' became redundant and did not convey any useful data.
With the advent of ajbbooks 2.0 and the XML format it became possible
to easily include additional information. However, with only one
string field in the user form display it became necessary to encode
the information.  Starting with volume 42 I created the following
pagination codes.  These are still stored as a string in the XML file
until I create the parsers to read them.

At least one occurrence of 8p+529p+[27]p; c.f. 43.21(0).08 what do the
brackets mean?

There are at least a few cases where the pagination is listed as
"<count>+<count>+A<count>+B<count> pp" where A, B, etc., indicate
appendices that are separately numbered.

Some page counts use Roman numerals so the characters I, V, X, L, C,
D, and M should not be used for the code suffix or prefix. However, if
we have an appendix C with Roman pagination, we have a conflict. Just
such a situation occurs in 43.51(0).01. I used brackets around the
page count as VIIIp+A78p+B16p+C[IXp+161p]+D66p+E46p+F38p. Also
brackets multiple collections of pages per appendix, as in the example
above, Appendix C has 9 pages of introduction and 161 pages of
material, this occurs also in 22.51(0).03.

A most interesting pagination string can be found in AJB 06.35.1007
Astronomical and Meteorological Observations made at the Royal Observatory,
Greenwich  in the Year 1900.
17+CXXXV+[139]+(130)+{123}+187+[{\it 101}]+({\it 90}
+xix_{72}+{/it 39}+8+lvii+({\sm cxvii})+13+7+27 S. 
Which I have not idea what this means.

Another interesting one is AJB 06.35.1015
Annales de l'Observatoire de Paris; Observations 1899
X+A.84+B.100+C.94+D.24+E.27+F.187+G.17
Which probably refers to the introduction and seven appendices


Code should provide
element PaginationToXml(string)
string XmlToPagination(element)
  but who allocates the memory??
  who frees the memory??
