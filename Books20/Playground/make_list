Testing procedure

copy previous Makefile or Makefile.am to *.orig
copy Makefile_generic.am to Makefile.am in each directory that had a previous Makefile
add relevant sub-directories to each Makefile.am
update comment
update configure.ac if new Makefile.am are required
add proper makefile.local link
run bootstrap and configure
test generic make target and look for all responses
  The previous has been completed succesfully

test prefix from makefile.local
  The previous has been completed succesfully

Problem:
  Makefile's don't work locally because BOOKS20_ROOT is not defined
  and they can not find makefile.local.  Tcs defined HET_SRC_ROOT as
  an environment variable to get around this. If defined in the environment
  then local make works.
 Answer:
  Defined BOOKS20_ROOT in my .bashrc. Local make work successfully.

Problem:
  Where is BOOKS20_DIR used?
  Can we use BOOKS20_ROOT in its place?
 Answer:
  No where except in local_vars. But may be used in install_*
  or build_*. Will have to see if we need to use it.
  

Edit lower Makefile.am to add real targets
get rid of echo for active targets
test
work upward to upper Makefile
