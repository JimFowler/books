What constitutes a book? The question has been debated since the study
of books began.  My definition of the interesting book in astronomy
and astrophysics during the \Cen{20} is

Not listed as being in a known journal.

If a publisher and place is listed, the entry will probably be included

Should be longer than a typical journal article. However, there are
some definite journal articles that at greater than 100 pages long and
there are many books that are a short 20 pages or less.  There are
also many short paginations with out journal or publisher. These may
be pamphlets, notes, or something else.

Observatory occasional publications are usually not included.

NASA special, technical publications are not included.

Annuals, almanacs, tide tables are not included. Though they may be
important to some folks, they do not consitute an interesting book to
me.

How tired I am!
