Notes regarding graphical user interfaces or windows programs

J. R. Fowler


a main window program should have no public functions
  all information passed in via __init__() and config file
  interactive user input does the rest.
  (However, external python file may need access to the functions)
  Link buttons through the designer process
  Link menu functions through the designer as well??

 Use 0MQ to communicate between windows

 keep number of instance attibutes to a minimum, use dictionaries?
   This may not be possible! In which case use
   #pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes

 define ALL instance variables at the top of the window.  This way
   we can identify what is available.
   
 Use '\' to continue long lines and not use the default indentation
