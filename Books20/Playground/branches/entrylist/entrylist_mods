Phase One
Want to modify lib/entrylist.py to be a list of just entries.
So we move the header to a separate variable under the entrylist
instead of making it the first entry in the list.

Then we don't have to check for the zero count when stepping through
list.

Phase Two
Want to also add the ability to add two lists together by
concatenating the headers and extending the lists

Phase Three
add sort functions on authors, titles, years, etc. Sort functions
should be in the list calling function and passed to the list.sort()
routine.


For Lib

Modify aabooks/lib/entrylist.py
Ran unittests in master.  All pass successfully
modify entrylist.py, make separate header variable and modified
 max_entries()
ran unittests in entrylist branch. All pass successfully
commit as entrylist ff674bc
see entrylist.py_diffs


For Ajbbooks

Modify aabooks/ajbbook/bookfile.py
Ran unittests in master, test_c reports 19742!= 20142 for length of shortlist
I believe this is due to the change in shortlist size so that it would
fit in a window without wrapping lines around. I accept this failure
and will modify this in the branch

modify make_short_title_list
modify write_file_xml
modify write_file_txt


Modify entry count for next/prev buttons in ajbwindow.py
add '- 1' to line 485 in show_entry().  This means that the user display is
still counting from 1 but internally we are counting from 0.

modify save_entry
modify insert_entry
modify delete_entry
modify show_entry

testfile_tmp.xml is missing terminating return


For Journals

Modify aabooks/journal/journalfile.py
Ran unittests in master. All four tests pass

modify make_short_title_list
modify write_file_xml
modify test_c_make_short_title_list

Modify aabooks/journal/journalwindow.py
modify _build_search_dictionary
modify show_entry()
modify _save_entry
modify _insert_entry
modify delete_entry
modify print_entry

Modfy jsearch.py
