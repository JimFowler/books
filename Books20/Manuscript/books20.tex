\chapter{Speculations on the Future}

It is always perilous to speculate about the future.
What will be the exciting topics in astronomy and astrophysics?
Will we see images of exo-planets?  Will larger space telescopes
give us views we can't imagine today?

what of books in the age of the internet?
It is going to be interesting to see how publishing
changes in this age of information.  Will
summary works still be printed? What of the permanence
of documents published on the web only?

\chapter{Afterword}

The back matter often includes one or more of an index, an afterword,
acknowledgements, a bibliography, a colophon, or any other similar item. In
the back matter, chapters do not produce a chapter number, but they are
entered in the table of contents. If you are not using anything in the back
matter, you can delete the back matter \TeX field and everything that follows it.
