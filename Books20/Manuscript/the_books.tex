\chapter{The Books}

\textbf{What order should the books be listed in? Alphabetic, by author or title? By subject,
stellar, galactic, radio, visual? By date? I'm inclined to list them by date at this time.
What about multiple editions or first editions published in Europe and the USA?  How do
we list them under one book entry?}

The books are listed by date of publication in order to emphasize the historical
development of astronomy.  Where there are multiple books
published in a single year, they are listed alphabeticly by the author's last
name.

The entries contain an index number, the author(s), title, date, place
of publication, and publisher.  Also included is a bibliographic description of the 
book.  This is followed by any references to other lists, if such exist. Finally
a comment as to why the book is considered important as well as any publishing
history known, e.g.\ number of edition, translation, etc.

A book entry is formated as follows:

\exbkentry{Year}{Author}{Title}{place of publication, Publisher}
{Bibliographic description}{References to other lists}
Reasons why the book is important and any publishing history.

\section*{References}
References to other lists are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item AAA --- \emph{Astronomy and Astrophysics Abstracts}, \cite{aaa:1969},
References are given as AAAvvv.sss.nnn, where vvv is the volume number, sss is the section number (usually 003, books), and nnn is the index number in the section.

Goodman and Ji, J. Fluid Mech. (2002) 462, 365, point out that Chandra
dropped an important term in his discussion of magnetorotational
instabilty (MRI). This term turned out to be important in the
discussion of accretion disks and angular momentum transfer.  I found

by the University of Chicago Press, Chicago, in 1965.  Although astrometry
was no longer the leading subject in astronomy as it was in the early \Cen{19},
it was becoming more important with the rise of the space program and the requirement
of hitting what you aim for.

{DeV 122}
An annual series of review articles in topics of current interest.  This has become
the standard to which astronomers and students turn when they wish to
begin research on a subject.  From 1977 on the volumes also included a brief biographical
article by a senior astronomer. The series was edited by Leo Goldberg, A.J.\ Deutsch,
D.\ Layzer, J.\ Phillips and G.\ Burbidge.
