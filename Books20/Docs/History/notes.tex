\bt{Astrophysics and Cosmology}

Malcom S.\ Longair

In Chapter 23 of \bt{Twentieth Century Physics} (\cite{Physics1995},
page 1691), Malcom Longair (\cite{Longair1995}) briefly discusses the
history of astrophysics and cosmology in \Cen{20}.  This 132 page
chapter was later expanded into his 2006 book \bt{The Cosmic Century};
a much longer work on \Cen{20} astrophysics.

Longair divides this work and the century into four parts

\begin{enumerate}
\item Stars and Stellar Evolution up to World War II
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The legacy of the nineteenth century
  \item The origin of the Hertsprung-Russel diagram
  \item Stellar structure and evolution
  \end{enumerate}

\item The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe 1900-1939
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The structure of our galaxy
  \item The great debate
  \item The development of relativistic cosmology
  \end{enumerate}

\item The Opening Up of the Electromagnetic Spectrum
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The changing astronomical perspective
  \end{enumerate}

\item Astrophysics and Cosmolgoy since 1945
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Stars and stellar evolution since 1945
  \item The physics of the interstellar medium
  \item The physics of galaxies and cluster of galaxies
  \item High-energy astrophysics
  \item Astrophysics Cosmology
  \item The classical cosmological problem
  \item Galaxy formation
  \item The very early universe
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

As other authors have noted, he make a clear distinction between pre- and
post-World War II.
