Harlan James Smith (1924--1991) was born in Wheeling, West Virginia on
25 August 1924, graduating high school there in 1942.
\footnote{Much of this information has been taken from the obituary
written by James N.~Douglas in the Bulletin of the
AAS\cite{Douglas1992Harlan} as well as from the pamphlet ``The Harlan
J.~Smith Centennial Professorship in Astronomy'' (see entry 7 in the
catalogue.) and the pamphlet ``The Edward Randall Jr.,
M.D\. Centennial Professorship in Astronomy'' (see entry 9 in the
catalogue).} Joining the Army Air Corp in 1943 he finished his service
career as a meteorologist on Guadalcanal.  Harlan obtained his
undergraduate degree in 1949 and his PhD in 1955, both from
Harvard. His thesis was on short period variable stars where he
recognized that they were more like Cepheids than RR Lyrae stars.
These stars he called dwarf Cepheid's though they are now called delta
Scuti stars \cite{HJSPhD}, \cite{HJS1955},

Harlan joined the faculty at Yale in 1953 eventually obtaining the
rank of Associate Professor. There he began working in radio astronomy
where he and his students studied the decameter radio pulses from
Jupiter. He and Dorrit Hoffleit also studied the optical variablity of
the newly discovered quasers and found unequivocal evidence for
variations in 3C273 implying a small physical size and, given the
large distances from the redshift, a high luminosity \cite{HJS1963}.

In 1950, while in graduate school at Harvard, Harlan met Joan Greene
who was attending Ratcliffe College. There were married in December
1950. They had four children, Nat, Julie, Tad, and Hannah.

In 1963 Harlan was recruited to be the first ``Texas'' director of the
McDonald Observatory as well as Chairman of the Astronomy Department
at Texas. During his directorship the department and the observatory
grew in faculty and staff size with a strong emphasis on undergraduate
teaching. He resigned at Deparment Chairman in ???? citing the heavy
work load from the enlarged staff but remained as Director of McDonald
Observatory. He was appointed to the Edward Randell Jr.,MD Centennial
Professorship in Astronomy in 1984 (see catalogue entry 9).  Harlan
was also committed to public education and outreach.  He encouraged
the McDonald Observatory News (later Star Date magazine) and the Moody
Visitor's Center.

A large observatory needed to have the best telescopes and
instrumentation so the Otto Struve Telescope was refurbished in the
mid-1960's and talks for a larger telescope were started.  The 107
inch telescope was dedicated in 1969 and was later renamed the Harlan
J.~Smith Telescope in ????. The first lunar laser ranging signals
from the moon were detected in Aug 1969 and the laser ranging
continued until ????; one of the longest experiments at the McDonald
Observatory. The construction of the 107 inch telescope required
support for the visiting astronomer as well as a larger staff so the
new Transient Quarters (later the Astronomer's Lodge) was built as
well as 15 additional staff houses. A program in radio astronomy was
developed with the construction of the University of Texas Radio
Observatory (UTRAO) and the Millimeter Wave Observatory was later
moved to the observatory. In 1978 he started advocating for an even
larger telescope at McDonald, the 300 inch Eye of Texas. This was not
to be due to the economic collapse of 1985. He did, however, start
discussions with Penn State University about the the Hobby-Eberly
Telescope (the former Spectroscopic Survey Telescope) which was
dedicated in 1997,

Harlan was strongly committed to public service for astronomy and was
a member of the Royal Astronomical Society, the International
Astronomical Union, the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, and the American Astronomical Society. He was Chairman of the
Planetary Division of the AAS from 1974--1976, AAS Council Member from
1975--1978, and Vice-President of the AAS from 1977-1979. He served on
the national stage as a member of the Committee on the Large Space
Telescope (later the Hubble Space Telescope) from 1966--1970 and as a
member of the Space Science Board (SSB) of the National Academy of
Sciences where he was also Chairman of the Committtee on Space
Astronomy and Astrophysics of the SSB. Harlan was a member of the
Board of Directors of the Associated Universities for Research in
Astronomy (AURA) 1972--1983 and was Chairman of the Board from
1980--1983. He was also Chairman of the Managment/Operations Working
Group for Planetary Astronomy (NASA) 1988--1991.  He received
the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal in 1991.

Harlan retired as Director of the McDonald Observatory in 1989 but
continued to teach until his death on 17 October 1991.
