Many of the items contain a bookplate \textbf{`From the library of
  Harlan J.~Smith'}.  This bookplate was designed by Joan Smith and
added to the books when they were first sent to the McDonald
Library. The bookplate shows Mt.~Locke as viewed from the north-east
with the 107 inch Harlan J.~Smith telescope in the foreground, the 82
inch Otto Struve telescope behind it, and the 36 inch telescope in the
small dome to the left.The Latin inscription \textit{``Sic itur ad
  astra''} translates as \textit{``So we go to the stars''}.

Many of the books also contain the library stamp of Harlan J.~Smith,
usually on the title page. These personalized stamps were quite
popular in the 1970s. This stamp was added by Harlan. In addition,
there is usually a signature or initials of Harlan on the front free
end paper, though occasionally it may appear elsewhere.

A number of books appear to have been purchased from used book dealers.
There are also a number of duplicate books to be found among all the
entries.

Harlan's interests, as indicated by books, are primarily in planetary
studies and space exploration and development. But there are also
works on the history of astronomy, philosophy of science, life on
earth, alien intellegence. and the colonization of space. There is
also a strong interest in climate change dating back to the 1970's.
A number of reports are from his work with the various boards and
committees that he served on.
