The Harlan J.~Smith Book Collection at the McDonald Observatory has 501
catalogued entries, however, a number of the catalogued entries refer
to multi-volume works or consist of multiple reprints and articles so
there are many more than 500 items in the collection.

This collection represents only a small part of Harlan's reading
interests.  It primarily consists of his science library; the working
books he might have used on a daily basis or for reference.  Harlan's
interests, as indicated by books, are primarily in planetary studies
and space exploration and development. But there are also works on
math, physics, the history of astronomy, philosophy of science, life
on earth, alien intelligence, and the colonization of space. There is
also a strong interest in climate change dating back to the 1970's. (A
well rounded scientist indeed!) The collection includes reports from
his work with the various boards and committees that he served on,
while others are gifts from their authors or interesting works he
picked up in his travels.

Many of the items contain the bookplate {\bfseries\textsc{`From the
    library of} \textit{Harlan J.~Smith'}}, usually on the inside front
cover. This bookplate was designed by Joan Smith and added to the
books when they were first sent to the McDonald Library. The plate
shows Mt.~Locke as viewed from the north-east with the 107-inch Harlan
J.~Smith telescope in the foreground, the 82-inch Otto Struve
telescope behind it, and the 36-inch telescope in the small dome to
the left.The Latin inscription \textsc{``Sic itur ad astra''}
translates as \textsc{``So we go to the stars''}.

Many of the books also contain the library stamp of Harlan J.~Smith,
usually on the title page. These personalized stamps were quite
popular in the 1980s. This stamp was added by Harlan. In addition,
there is usually a signature or initials of Harlan in the upper right
corner of the front free end paper, though occasionally they may appear
elsewhere.  These ownership marks are indicated in the catalogue.

A number of books appear to have been purchased from used book dealers.
There are also a number of duplicate books to be found among all the
entries. 

The first books were sent to the McDonald library in ????.  I saw a
paper copy of an inventory of the collection a number of years ago but
I have been unable to relocate that list. My cataloguing of this first
set was begun on 1 Dec 2021 and finally finished on 23 Oct 2022 after
a long delay. There were 298 items found in this original collection.

A second set of books were sent by Nat Smith on 2 November 2021.
Cataloguing occurred 10--11 April 2022. There were 4 boxes and 57 items
in this second shipment. A third set of books was received from
Jeffrey Mallon on 29 March 2022. These were catalogued on 9--10 April
2022. There were three boxes and 94 items in the third
shipment. Finally, a fourth shipment was received on 13 April 2022 and
catalogued on 16--17 April 2022. There were two boxes (1 cu ft) and
one small box (1/2 cu ft) with a total of 54 items in the fourth
shipment.  Work on the software to produce the catalog was started on
18 April 2022.

The catalogue is sorted by year and then author/editor. If there is no
note about the binding, then you may assume a hard bound book. If
there is an intact dust jacket, it is noted. A paperback book is
notated as having paper covers. (Entry \myhref{102} is interesting; it
has paper covers but also a paper dust jacket.) Any interesting
features of the item are noted as are any articles by HJS.  The HJS
catalogue number is ``HJS Shipment\#.Box\#.count'' where shipment 1 is
the existing collection at McDonald while shipments 2, 3, and 4 where
the later boxes shipped in 2021/22. The index is a cumulative count
for the separate shipments. The HJS catalogue number is my ordering of
the books as I catalogued them and form a basic shelf list that allows
me to locate the books again.  This will become meaningless once the
books are actually put up on the shelves in the library. Finally, an
index of author/editor(s) and the associated entry number(s) is
provided.

The catalogue entry format is,
