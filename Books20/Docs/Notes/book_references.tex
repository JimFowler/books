Alexander et.\ al., in their article {\it The Exploration History of
Europa}\cite{Alexander2009} reference a number of books in a
discussion of the history of the observation and study of Jupiter's
moon Europa.  The books range from Galileo Galilei's \bt{Sidereus
Nuncius}\cite{Galilei1989} to Arthur C.\ Clarke's \bt{2010: Odyssey
Two}\cite{Clarke1982}.
