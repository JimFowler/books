\begin{quote}

\ldots [this story] is especially pertinent for a writer who is
obsessed with books in every imaginable sense and nuance of the
word. I am fascinated by their history and composition, by the many
shapes and forms they have assumed over time. I want to know
everything I can about the people who write them, make them, preserve
them, sell them, cover them, collect them, fear them, ban them,
destroy them, and, most of all, about those who are moved,
entertained, instructed, awed, and inspired by them\ldots

"An image is worth a thousand words, but a spectrum is worth a
million," said lead author Ben R. Oppenheimer, associate curator and
chair of the Astrophysics Department at the American Museum of
Natural History.

  ``The point isn't that books aren't special --- it's that they're special
  because of what we can learn from them, which includes thinking critically
  about what they might signify to us."

  last accessed 2021-07-10. The point is that books are special
  because of what they can tell us about ourselves and others.  Both
  from their materiality as well as from their contents.
