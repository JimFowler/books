Bibliography Styles


Bibliographies may be enumerative, descriptive, ...

bibliographies may be used to
  list works in a collection
  list works in a subject field but not in a collection
  list works in an area or county


Basicly bibliography is such a broad term that you can write
the list in any form you want.


  As a simple enumerative bibliography a simple author, title list
suffices

    # Last, First Middle, \it Title, Place: Publisher, Year

  The Descriptive entry style varies by bibliography but most that I
have seen are listed alphabetically by Author or by publication date.
The San Diego State University lists their rare astronomical books by
Author as

    # Last, First Middle, birth-death

    \it Title

    Place: Publisher, Year

    Description

    Comments

    Other bibliography references

An alternate style, written as a paragraph to conserve space is,

  Last, First Middle, \it Title, Place: Publisher, Year, Description

The last threee fields are optional or may be left out
if no information exists.  The ordering may change as well. For example,
if you wanted the list by year of publication, then the year would go
first.

Multiple author/editors or sub-titles are handled how?
