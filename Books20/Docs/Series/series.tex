\section{Introduction}

Some of the books in \Cen{20} both popular as well as technical were published
as a series.  Some questions we might ask are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Why are series used by publishers and editors in general?
  \item How do these series fit into the bigger picture of book publishing?
  \item Why publish as a series in astronomy and astrophysics?
  \item What series exist in astronomy and astrophysics?
\end{itemize}
