\section{Astrophysics and Space Science Library}

The series {\it Astrophysics and Space Science Library} was published
by Kluwer Academic from 1965-1999 and by Springer after 2000 following
their acquisition of Kluwer.  The ISSN number is 0067-0057. There are
some 440+ titles in the series as of 2018 and they are continuing to be
published.  It appears that most of the volumes are monographs but some
are workshop papers while others are historical. See Table \ref{assl-kluwer:1}
for the complete listing.
