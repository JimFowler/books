The series {\bf Harvard Books on Astronomy} was a collection of popular books
on astronomical topics with the latest science presented by acknowledged experts
in the field. There were two series of books, the first running from 1941 to 1951
and publised by The Blakiston Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The seconds series
began in 1951 with revisions of some of the previous editions as well as new books on
current topics although some books from the first series were dropped.
