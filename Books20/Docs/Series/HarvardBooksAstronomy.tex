\section{Harvard Monographs in Astronomy}

Published by the Harvard University Press for the Harvard Observatory.
These books were professional monographs designed for the working
astronomer.  As such there was no general editor. Although published over
many years these volumes recognize some of the milesstones in Astronomy and
Astrophyics.  See table \ref{HMA:1} for the publishing details.
