In the tables below an asterisk by the book means that I have a copy.

Some of the books in \Cen{20} both popular as well as technical were published
as a series. Some questions we might ask are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Why are series used by publishers and editors in general?
  \item How do these series fit into the bigger picture of book publishing?
  \item Why publish as a series in astronomy and astrophysics?
  \item What series exist in astronomy and astrophysics?
\end{itemize}

Read the editor's introduction, usually in the first volume, to
find the answers to the questions.
  
Of each series we can ask;

\begin{itemize}
  \item Is this a popular work or a professional volume?
  \item How well does it achieve this goal?
  \item How many copies of each printing were produced?
  \item How well did these copies sell?
\end{itemize}
