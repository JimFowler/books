\section{Why do I collect books}

\begin{itemize}
\item I want to read them (but I haven't yet). I buy them faster than
  I can read them.
\item I want to have them as references
\item I am an introvert
\item Averse to throwing books away
\item Fantasy that if I have the book I have the knowledge
\end{itemize}

\section{Why is this book important to me?}

\begin{itemize}
\item UT/UoC connections
\item Written by or association copies of astronomers I know
\item My subject/interest area
\end{itemize}

\section{Resources}

From {\itshape Fine Books and Collection}, winter 2020 p59, collecter
Glynn Crain offers this advice to collectors, ``Get out there and meet
people, meet the collectors, meet the dealers and participate in
auctions and go to conventions. That's how you put a collection
together. It's really the only way to do it''.
