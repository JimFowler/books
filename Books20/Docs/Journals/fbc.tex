  The predecessor of this magazine, OP, began life in 2003 with Scott
  Brown, a bookseller, and dee Stewart, already involved in
  publishing, as co-owners and publisher and editor
  respectively. Journalistic, Inc., purchased Dee's interest in Fall
  2004, wht the magazine was renamed {\it Fine Books \& Collections}
  and re-designed. Webb Howell became publisher and Scott became
  editor. Nick Basbanes began as our lead columnists. Kimberly Draper
  joined the magazine in early 2005 as associated publisher. In 2008,
  Scott sold his interest to Journalistic, and returned to bookselling
  full time. In late 2008, Rosie Haller became art director and in
  late 2009, Rebecca Rego Barry joined the magazine as editor. The
  rest, as they say, is history.

Note that in 2009 no issues were published.  Only a Compendium 2010
was released.  The magazine then started published again on a quartely
schedule rather than the bi-monthly schedule that had been used
previously.
