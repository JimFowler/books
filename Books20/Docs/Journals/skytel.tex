\section{Sky \& Telescope}

These note are taken from \bt{Sky \& Telescope}, volume 1, number 1,
November 1941.

\bt{Sky \& Telescope} began in Nov, 1941, as a merger between \bt{The
  Sky} and \bt{The Telescope}, both of which were losing money at the
time.  The first editor was Charles A.~Federer jr.\ and his wife Helen
Spencer Federer.

\bt{The Telescope} was published starting in 1931 at
the Perkins Observatory of the Ohio Wesleyan University and was edited
by Harlan T.~Stetson. Three years later he moved to the Massachusetts
Institue of Technology where he invited the Bond Astronomical Club and
the Harvard Observatory to take over the magazine. Thus in June, 1934
Dr.~Loring B.~Andrews became the editor and publication began in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.  When Andrews left for England in 1937, Donald H.~Menzel
became the editor.

\bt{Amateur Astronomer} was first published in April, 1929, by the
Amateur Astronomical Association, which was headquartered in the American
Museum of Natural History in New York, as a 4 page monthly bulletin of
short articles and items of interest for the coming month.  With
Volume IV, Winter 1933/34 the magazine took the step to a larger
quarterly format.  In October of 1936 it merged with the \bt{Monthly
  Bulletin} of the Hayden Planetarium and the name was changed to
\bt{The Sky}. By 1939 the American Museum could no longer financially
support the magazine and it passed into the hands of assistant
editor Charles and Helen Federer. \bt{The Sky} continued through
its fifth volume and then merged to become \bt{Sky \& Telescope}.
