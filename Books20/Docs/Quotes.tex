\ldots [this story] is especially pertinent for a writer who is
obsessed with books in every imaginable sense and nuance of the
word. I am fascinated by their history and composition, by the many
shapes and forms they have assumed over time. I want to know
everything I can about the people who write them, make them, preserve
them, sell them, cover them, collect them, fear them, ban them,
destroy them, and, most of all, about those who are moved,
entertained, instructed, awed, and inspired by them\ldots
