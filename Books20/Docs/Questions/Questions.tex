\section{Some Questions}

How does the list of journals reviewed in AJB reflect the
development of \Cen{20} Astronomy and Astrophysics?

Can we count the number of titles?

Can we see which titles from which cities lasted the longest?

Does the loss of titles reflect the centralization of knowledge
within organizations rather than observatories? Does it reflect the
increasing production costs of publication?
