2016-08-07  Jim Fowler  <jrf@biblion>

	* Tools/bookentry/journalWin.py (JournalEntry.printPrinter): Made
	minor changes to journal.

2016-04-11  Jim Fowler  <jrf@biblion>

	* Tools/bookentry/mainWindow.py (BookEntry.saveFileAs): modified
	to use self.bf.getDirName() as the directory to start in.

	* Data/Ajb: Converted all files to XML format and saved with git.

2016-02-07  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/bookentry/AJBcomments.py (Compilers): Removed ",
	OPTIONAL(WhiteSpace))" from the definition of Compilers.  In the
	situation where the 'compiled by' was the only comment the grammer
	would not recognize it.  This implies that every volume from AJB45
	to AJB68 may have lost compiler date.  Will need to proofread
	these volumes again and look for compiler information. The original
	inclusion of the offending statement occured in the check in of
	2015-05-17 so volumes before this date may not be affected. The
	last file before this date was ajb47_books.txt.  The last file
	with a compiled by entry is ajb57_books.txt

	* Tools/bookentry/xml/bookfile.xsd: modifed personInfo to allow
	minOccurs=0 for 'Last'.  This means that personInfo may not have
	any child elements but was necessary because
	nameparser.HumanName() parses a single word as a first name rather
	than a last name. This behaviour seems to be a feature of
	HumanName.

2016-02-04  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/bookentry/mainWindow.py (BookEntry.askOpenFile): added
	additional filters to askOpenFile() and saveFileAs(). Set filename
	extension if not set be user.

	* Tools/bookentry/bookfile.py: Modified
	to support filename extensions.  readFile() and writeFile()
	modified to call the proper reader/writer depending on the
	extension.  Renamed old readFile() to readFile_Text() and
	old writeFile() to writeFile_Text().  Modified setFilename()
	to extract extension name.

2016-01-25  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/bookentry/AJBentry.py (AJBentry.HumanNameFmXML): created
	function to translate XML Person entry to HumanName object.
	(AJBentry.AJBnumFromIndex): created function to translate an
	XML Index entry to AJB string.

	I think this completes the read+XML_to_Entry() function.

2016-01-24  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/bookentry/search.py (SearchDict.search): added search
	function to SearchDict. Used distance of the sub-string from the
	start of the title as a metric for sorting.

	* fuzzywuzzy: installed version 0.8.0 for testing fuzzy matching
	of string in /home/jrf. This turns out to not be useful for
	my search/sort.

	* pep8: installed pep8 v1.7.0 python style guide checker in the
	system libraries.  It was needed by fuzzywuzzy but will be useful
	for other things.

	* Levenshtein: installed the python package python-leveshtein
	version 0.12.0 in /home/jrf

	* python3-dev: installed python3-dev package from Ubuntu in order
	to build Levenshtein package.

	* Tools/bookentry/search.py (SearchDict): Added sub-string
	generator to SearchDict. Tested routines with titleList.py.  Seems
	to work well.  But this package doesn't find the best matches.
	For a short sub-string we may get matches to many titles. Would
	like to get the top five best matches if we can.


2016-01-23  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/bookentry/search.py (SearchDict._getSubStrings): got
	the sub-string generator working correctly today.

2016-01-18  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/bookentry/search.py (SearchDict): wrote search dictionary
	to search for Titles based on sub-strings from the existing titles
	and abbreviations.

	* Tools/bookentry/xml/JournalFile_test.xml: modified to support
	new journalfile.xsd.

	and moved ISSN and ADSDesignator under it.  Changed ADSDesignator

	* Tools/bookentry/journalWin.py (JournalEntry.setFocusChanged):
	Connected symbol table to edit boxes.

2016-01-03  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/bookentry/journalWin.py (JournalEntry): Got the journal

	* Tools/src/BookEntry.py (BookEntry.indexChanged): small change to
	function. If in new entry and we change the index number and type
	return, a Save Dialog would pop up and the old index number would

	if there was one.

	ToLanguage 'English'.

2013-02-08  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/symbol.py (SymbolForm.__init__): switched from
	codecs.open() to open() since python3 and Ubuntu are Unicode be
	default.

	Microsoft Office inserted into the text file. Now I can read
	comments at the begining of the file with out error. Note that all
	the ajb??_books.txt files also have BOM at the beginning. Use
	'vim -b <filename>' to edit <filename> as a binary file.

	to set indexEntry to current entry number if indexEntry lost
	focus.  Then, if you change the indexEntry but do not hit return
	and you tab out of the field, the number returns to the current
	index number.

2013-02-05  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/BookEntry.py: Added Edition, Reprint and Reference
	fields to user interface.

	termintate a Reference comment. Will have to change all the
	ajb??_books.doc/txt files. AJBcomments.py just could not handle
	Reference at the end of a line with out some sort of termination
	characters.

2013-02-02  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/BookEntry.py (BookEntry.setInsertFunc): got the

	using isEmpty().

2013-02-01  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/BookEntry.py (getargs): Figured out how to find out

	* Tools/src/headerWindow.py (main): Learned how to make dialog
	windows expand with the help of Walter Moriera in Austin.
	Converted the headerWindow.py file to us a designer gui
	rather than the handcrafted one.  All seems to work well.

2013-01-05  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/headerWindow.py (main): Converted headerWindow()
	to a QDialog and give up for the time being on making it
	expandable. Tested with BookEntry and it appears to work.

2013-01-03  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/headerWindow.py (headerWindow): created headerWindow
	class and gui that will expand with the window. Added some actions

2013-01-01  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/BookEntry.py (BookEntry): Restored BookEntry.py
	version from prior to 28 Dec.  Got it working with the bookfile
	class. Also got all the Gui text boxes to update. I can now
	display all but Translator, Compilers, Contributors, and Language.

	* Tools/src/AJBentry.py (AJBentry.write): finished the write()
	method. Corrected one problem in parseComments for 'reprint of'.

2012-12-28  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/BookEntry (BookEntry): Began building a new version of
	the BookEntry tools.  I was making too many mistakes with the
	manual entry in Word.


2012-10-14  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Data/Testing/AJBcomments.py (uWord): Added punctuation marks to
	the definition of uWord. So now I no longer use uWord2 or uWord3
	in the definition of uWords.  The Other grammar required too many
	special characters.  May switch this grammar to Other and use a
	smaller set of punctuation for uWord.  But I was able to
	successfully parse ajb??_books.txt for volumes 60-68; after many
	typo corrections.

2012-10-06  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Data/Testing/BookEntry.py (BookEntry.showRecord): Modifed
	forward and back buttons to wrap around the entry list.

2012-10-02  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	successfully now. And after a number of rewrites, ajb68_books.txt
	can now be fully parsed.

2012-10-01  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Data/Testing/AJBcomments.py (Comment): found out how to use
	regular expressions in modgrammar.  Need to use

	form of a uWord.

2012-09-27  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Data/Testing/entry.py: Created new Entry and AJBentry class

	encoding to work with QT. Had to add a line.decode('UTF-8') after
	the line was read from the file with fileinput

2012-08-13  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Data/Testing/entry.py (AJBentry.numStr): added numStr() function
	to AJBentry class.  Needed in Bookentry.py

2012-08-10  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	comments next.

2012-07-31  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Data/Testing/entry.py (AJBentry.MakeAuthorList): Wrote
	MakeAuthorList() today. Given a string with authors
	separated by 'and' it returns a list of dictionaries
	of the separate authors. The dictionary has First, Middle,
	Last, and Suffix entries

2012-07-30  James Fowler  <jrf12@James-Fowlers-MacBook-Pro.local>

	* Data/Testing/entry.py (parseAuthors):  modified parseAuthors to

	* Docs/TimeLine.ods: updated some entries.

2012-02-23  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* WebPages/Collecting.txt: Added rarebooksdigest.com to the

2011-12-01  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	for make. This builds html versions of my webpages instead of the
	php versions. But it would not work on the Mac, only on
	Biblion. Make could not find the phpBooks.inc.

2011-11-30  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>
