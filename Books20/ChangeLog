	trailing space.

2020-11-29  Jim Fowler  <jrf@biblion>

	* Tools/python/scripts/findjournals: write this script to find
	journal names or abbreviation in AJB files that do not exist in
	the journals.xml file.

	* Tools/python/scripts/verify: wrote the python script verify to
	check entries that are not checked at entry time. Primarily the
	pagination, page number, and reviewers checked.  Good thing too,
	as at least ajb68, ajb67, and ajb66 have missing entries and I
	just did those files a few weeks ago.

	* Tools/python/aabooks/lib/pagination_xml.py: Added two new
	tests for bad string. Also removed 'T', 'Tafellen' for Plates.

2020-10-30  Jim Fowler  <jrf@biblion>

	* Tools/python/aabooks/ajbbook/entrydisplay.py (display_entry_publishers):
	Add try/except clause around the parsing of the place:publisher
	string parsing.  Had a problem with a space in the entry form
	that caused ajbbooks to crash.

	Should split the entry_to_display() and display_to_entry()
	procedures into read/write_form()
	convert_string/entry_to_entry/string().  This will allow unittests
	on the string conversion functions

2020-09-06  Jim Fowler  <jrf@biblion>

	class to be a subclass of entrylist.EntryList().  Added unit tests
	and ran through pylint.

	* Tools/python/aabooks/ajbbook/entrytext.py: Found a number of
	issues with entrytext.py.  I had not tested the text functions in
	this file.  Added unit test to use write_text_from_entry().
	There is a deprecated usage in modgrammer that I need to clean
	up. Will need to add unittest to AJBcomments.py to find it.

	by taking all the entry to text and text to entry functions out of
	ajbentry.py.  Cleaned with pylint and did a full functional test
	of all features. Even though the text entry format is depricated I

	Name:Place...

2019-10-01  Jim Fowler  <jrf@biblion>

	* Tools/python/aabooks/ajbbook/designer/ui_BookEntry.ui: Extended
	item field.  Volume AJB 11 and earlier have sequential number of
	entries so the item number may exceed 3 digits.  Also removed
	shortcuts from the next/previous record buttons.

	* Tools/python/aabooks/ajbbook/menus.py: Added Ctrl+F and Ctrl+B
	as shortcuts to the next/prev entry menu items.

	adding additional error checking after I lost an hours worth of
	work today.

2017-01-01  Jim Fowler  <jrf@biblion>

	* Tools/bookentry/xml/price: created price document. Will
	add to documentation later.

	* Tools/doc/ajbbooks/conf.py: Changed version number in

2016-12-31  Jim Fowler  <jrf@biblion>

	ajbbooks v2.0.  Committed and tagged v2.0.

2016-12-24  Jim Fowler  <jrf@biblion>

	* Tools/journalWin.py: Changed signal connect to use new style signals
	which is the only mechanism supported in PyQt5.

	* Tools/journalMenus.py: Changed signal connect to use new style signals

	* Data/Ajb: Converted all files to XML format and saved with git.

2016-02-07  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/bookentry/AJBcomments.py (Compilers): Removed ",
	OPTIONAL(WhiteSpace))" from the definition of Compilers.  In the
	situation where the 'compiled by' was the only comment the grammer
	would not recognize it.  This implies that every volume from AJB45
	to AJB68 may have lost compiler date.  Will need to proofread
	these volumes again and look for compiler information. The original
	inclusion of the offending statement occured in the check in of
	2015-05-17 so volumes before this date may not be affected. The
	last file before this date was ajb47_books.txt.  The last file
	with a compiled by entry is ajb57_books.txt

	* Tools/bookentry/xml/bookfile.xsd: modifed personInfo to allow
	minOccurs=0 for 'Last'.  This means that personInfo may not have
	any child elements but was necessary because
	nameparser.HumanName() parses a single word as a first name rather
	than a last name. This behaviour seems to be a feature of
	HumanName.

2016-02-04  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/bookentry/mainWindow.py (BookEntry.askOpenFile): added
	additional filters to askOpenFile() and saveFileAs(). Set filename
	extension if not set be user.

	* Tools/bookentry/bookfile.py: Modified
	to support filename extensions.  readFile() and writeFile()
	modified to call the proper reader/writer depending on the
	extension.  Renamed old readFile() to readFile_Text() and
	old writeFile() to writeFile_Text().  Modified setFilename()
	to extract extension name.

2016-01-25  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/bookentry/AJBentry.py (AJBentry.HumanNameFmXML): created
	function to translate XML Person entry to HumanName object.
	(AJBentry.AJBnumFromIndex): created function to translate an
	XML Index entry to AJB string.

	I think this completes the read+XML_to_Entry() function.

2016-01-24  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/bookentry/search.py (SearchDict.search): added search
	function to SearchDict. Used distance of the sub-string from the
	start of the title as a metric for sorting.

	* fuzzywuzzy: installed version 0.8.0 for testing fuzzy matching
	of string in /home/jrf. This turns out to not be useful for
	my search/sort.

	* pep8: installed pep8 v1.7.0 python style guide checker in the
	system libraries.  It was needed by fuzzywuzzy but will be useful
	for other things.

	* Levenshtein: installed the python package python-leveshtein
	version 0.12.0 in /home/jrf

	* python3-dev: installed python3-dev package from Ubuntu in order
	to build Levenshtein package.

	* Tools/bookentry/search.py (SearchDict): Added sub-string
	generator to SearchDict. Tested routines with titleList.py.  Seems
	to work well.  But this package doesn't find the best matches.
	For a short sub-string we may get matches to many titles. Would
	like to get the top five best matches if we can.


2016-01-23  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/bookentry/search.py (SearchDict._getSubStrings): got
	the sub-string generator working correctly today.

	* Tools/bookentry/xml/JournalFile_test.xml: modified to support

2013-02-26  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/BookEntry.py (BookEntry.indexChanged): small change to
	function. If in new entry and we change the index number and type
	return, a Save Dialog would pop up and the old index number would
	return. Thus you would not go on to the index you wanted. Move the
	read of the new index number to before the askSaveEntry() dialog.

2013-02-17  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/doc/introduction.rst: added more to the introduction in
	order to explain the layout of the BookEntry program.

	* Tools/src/BookEntry.py (BookEntry.DisplayToEntry): Spent an hour
	and a half last night proofreading the first 99 entries in
	ajb58_books.txt only to find out that Save Record was not working
	correctly.  Changed DisplayToEntry() to return an entry value
	rather than trying to manipulate the entry through a passed in
	argument.

2013-02-09  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/origstrWindow.py: added dialog to view original string
	if there was one.

	* Tools/src/AJBentry.py (AJBentry._parseComments): Fixed bug in
	parsing of Translation. Use tmp.elements[1] instead of
	results.find(uWord). The later case was finding the first uWord in
	'translated from Russian into English' when looking for the
	ToLanguage 'English'.

2013-02-08  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/symbol.py (SymbolForm.__init__): switched from
	codecs.open() to open() since python3 and Ubuntu are Unicode be
	default.

	* Tools/src/symbols.txt: removed the BOM (byte order mark) that
	Microsoft Office inserted into the text file. Now I can read
	comments at the begining of the file with out error. Note that all
	the ajb??_books.txt files also have BOM at the beginning. Use
	'vim -b <filename>' to edit <filename> as a binary file.

2013-02-06  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/symbol.py (SymbolForm.__init__): Modified to include
	toolTips and comments in the symbol table file.

	* Tools/src/symbols.txt: Built first symbol table with the
	characters that I remember using.

	* Tools/src/BookEntry.py (BookEntry.__init__): Added reprintEntry
	and referenceEntry to noEntryList.

	* Tools/src/AJBentry.py (AJBentry.write): added semi-colon when
	printing reference in comments.

	* Tools/src/BookEntry.py (BookEntry.setFocusChanged): added test
	to set indexEntry to current entry number if indexEntry lost
	focus.  Then, if you change the indexEntry but do not hit return
	and you tab out of the field, the number returns to the current
	index number.

2013-02-05  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/BookEntry.py: Added Edition, Reprint and Reference
	fields to user interface.
	(BookEntry.indexChanged): added function to jump to an entry if
	the index number is edited.

	* Tools/src/AJBcomments.py (Reference): require semi-colon to
	termintate a Reference comment. Will have to change all the
	ajb??_books.doc/txt files. AJBcomments.py just could not handle
	Reference at the end of a line with out some sort of termination
	characters.

2013-02-02  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/BookEntry.py (BookEntry.setInsertFunc): got the
	insertFunc to work today. I can now insert special characters or
	symbols from the symbolTable.
	(BookEntry.DisplayToEntry): began writing function. Having trouble
	using isEmpty().

2013-02-01  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/BookEntry.py (getargs): Figured out how to find out
	which Entry window has the focus.  Need to use
	QApplication.focusChanged()

2013-01-27  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/BookEntry.py (BookEntry): added saveEntry, newEntry,
	saveFile, saveFileAs, newFile, openFile, askSaveEntry, and
	askSaveFile.

	* Tools/src/bookfile.py (BookFile): set default name in __init__.

2013-01-26  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	setNewEntry functions.

2013-01-13  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/symbol.py: Began writing the symbol table code.
	Adapted the character_picker code from Rich Griswold's package.
	Switched to branch insert_symbol

	* Tools/src/headerWindow.py (main): Learned how to make dialog
	windows expand with the help of Walter Moriera in Austin.
	Converted the headerWindow.py file to us a designer gui
	rather than the handcrafted one.  All seems to work well.

2013-01-05  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/headerWindow.py (main): Converted headerWindow()
	to a QDialog and give up for the time being on making it
	expandable. Tested with BookEntry and it appears to work.

2013-01-03  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/headerWindow.py (headerWindow): created headerWindow
	class and gui that will expand with the window. Added some actions
	and worked out how to link with the main BookEntry class.

2013-01-01  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/BookEntry.py (BookEntry): Restored BookEntry.py
	version from prior to 28 Dec.  Got it working with the bookfile
	class. Also got all the Gui text boxes to update. I can now
	display all but Translator, Compilers, Contributors, and Language.

	* Tools/src/AJBentry.py (AJBentry.write): finished the write()
	method. Corrected one problem in parseComments for 'reprint of'.
	Wasn't getting the year, only the AJBnum.

2012-12-31  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/AJBentry.py (AJBentry.write): added function
	to write out the string version of an AJB entry.

	out of entry.py. Wrote isValid() function as well as isValidAjbNum().
	Converted extract() to read().  Converted parse*() functions to
	private functions.

	* Tools/src/entry.py (Entry): added write() and isValid()
	definitions for sub-classes. Changed extract() to read().

2012-12-28  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Tools/src/BookEntry (BookEntry): Began building a new version of
	the BookEntry tools.  I was making too many mistakes with the
	manual entry in Word.


2012-10-14  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Data/Testing/AJBcomments.py (uWord): Added punctuation marks to
	the definition of uWord. So now I no longer use uWord2 or uWord3
	in the definition of uWords.  The Other grammar required too many
	special characters.  May switch this grammar to Other and use a
	smaller set of punctuation for uWord.  But I was able to
	successfully parse ajb??_books.txt for volumes 60-68; after many
	typo corrections.

2012-10-06  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Data/Testing/BookEntry.py (BookEntry.showRecord): Modifed
	forward and back buttons to wrap around the entry list.

	* Data/Testing/AJBcomments.py (Section): Changed Section and
	Item to accept 2 or 3 digit numbers.

	last name in an 'edited by' entry.

	* Data/Testing/entry.py (AJBentry.parseComments): added spaces
	to the split(' and ') in the Publisher list. This avoids problems
	with 'Rand McNally & Sons' in the 'also published' list.

	* Data/Testing/AJBcomments.py (Contributors): Added compilers
	and Contributors grammar

2012-10-02  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Data/Testing/AJBcomments.py (Comment): Figured out how to make
	uWord and uAbrv work to created uWords.  All test case pass
	successfully now. And after a number of rewrites, ajb68_books.txt
	can now be fully parsed.

2012-10-01  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Data/Testing/AJBcomments.py (Comment): found out how to use
	regular expressions in modgrammar.  Need to use
	modgrammar.extras.RE. Now I just need to figure out the grammar
	form of a uWord.

2012-09-27  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Data/Testing/entry.py: Created new Entry and AJBentry class
	based on the dict class rather than the object class.  No need
	for a dictionary as a class variable.

	encoding to work with QT. Had to add a line.decode('UTF-8') after
	the line was read from the file with fileinput

2012-08-13  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Data/Testing/entry.py (AJBentry.numStr): added numStr() function
	to AJBentry class.  Needed in Bookentry.py

2012-08-10  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Data/Testing/entry.py (Entry.isValid): Added isValid() for
	use in BookEntry.py.

	comments next.

2012-07-31  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* Data/Testing/entry.py (AJBentry.MakeAuthorList): Wrote
	MakeAuthorList() today. Given a string with authors
	separated by 'and' it returns a list of dictionaries
	of the separate authors. The dictionary has First, Middle,
	Last, and Suffix entries

2012-07-30  James Fowler  <jrf12@James-Fowlers-MacBook-Pro.local>

	* Data/Testing/entry.py (parseAuthors):  modified parseAuthors to

	* Docs/TimeLine.ods: updated some entries.

2012-02-23  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* WebPages/Collecting.txt: Added rarebooksdigest.com to the

	* WebPages/Makefile.am: switched installation directory for
	the public web pages from $(PUBLICHTML) to $(htmldir). The

2011-12-01  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* WebPages/Makefile (install_html): Created install_html target
	for make. This builds html versions of my webpages instead of the
	php versions. But it would not work on the Mac, only on
	Biblion. Make could not find the phpBooks.inc.

2011-11-30  Jim Fowler  <jrf@Biblion>

	* WebPages/Collecting.txt: Added bookfinder.com to collecting
	list.

	repository will be in biblion:/home/git/books with distributed
	versions on biblion:/home/jrf and on my Mac Book. Just need to
	remember to push/pull frequently.
