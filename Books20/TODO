16 Aug 2018 What should be in the bookentry package? Any functions
   should be very generic and not depand on the specifics of journals,
   books, authors, etc. Consider name change of package to books20.
   Will need to revise documentation to include package and programs.

   Certainly parser.py, symbols.py, and symbols.txt. A copy of
   version.py for the package.

   Possibly some search tools as in search.py.

   headerWindow is used for both ajbbooks and journals as is
   entryselect.py

   Make subfolders of bookentry for ajbbooks and journals?
   Create branch to test this.
   

15 Aug 2018 ajbbooks has two different values of __version__, one in
   ajbbooks and one in bookenty.mainWindow.py.  Need to distinguish
   between programs versions and package versions.
 
14 Aug 2018 Consider if it is worthwhile to switch
   to eclipse. Note that I have been using emacs since 1983

14 Aug 2018 add .emacs file to Macbook

14 Aug 2018 Run pylint on all python files and
   correct any issues as required. Look for python
   cleanup commands in emacs. Consider autopep8 and
   py-autopep8.el

14 Aug 2018 Create copyright command in emacs
   determine what type of file we are currently in
     .tex, .py, .txt (default), .am, .ac, 
   open temporary buffer with generic_copyright.txt
   replace comment character with appropriate character
   replace <filename> with full path name, strip out everything
      before Books20
   replace <Year> with current year
   copy content
   insert in current file at current location
