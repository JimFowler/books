Overview
========

The **books** program is part of my *Collection* project, which is
designed to catalog books in my private library into an SQLite3
database.  **books** is designed to ease the cataloging of entries.

**books** was initially developed in Python 3.4.3 under Ubuntu 14.04
and uses Qt 4.8.6 with PyQt 4.10.4 for the graphical portions of the
software. The latest version (v1.0, Nov 2015) runs in Python 3.4.3
under Ubuntu 14.10 and uses Qt 4.8.6 with PyQt 4.10.4


History
=======

The original database was created in 1998 using the Microsoft Access
97 and was later upgraded through Access 2000 up to Acess 2013. The
Access database was not well designed as it was only the second
databases I had ever created.  Porting the data to SQLite3 was an
excersize in programming and an attempt to improve the database.
