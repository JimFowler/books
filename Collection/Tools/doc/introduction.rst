Overview
========

The **librarian** program is part of my *Collection* project, which is
designed to catalog books in my private library into an SQLite3
database.  **librarian** is designed to ease the cataloging of entries.

**librarian** was initially developed in Python 3.4.3 under Ubuntu 14.04
and uses Qt 4.8.6 with PyQt 4.10.4 for the graphical portions of the
software. The latest version (v1.0, Nov 2015) runs in Python 3.4.3
under Ubuntu 14.04 and uses Qt 4.8.6 with PyQt 4.10.4


History
=======

The original database was created in 1998 using Microsoft Access 97
and was later upgraded to Access 2000 and eventually to
Access 2013. The Access database was not well designed as it was only
the second databases I had ever created.  Porting the data to SQLite3
was an exercise in programming and an attempt to improve the
database.
